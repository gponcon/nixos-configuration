:::note[Multi-user, multi-host, multi-network NixOS configuration with:]
- A simplified high-level configuration.
- A consistent and modular structure.
- Ready-to-use modules, profiles and tools.
- An organization designed for scalability.
:::

## Features

- **[Multi-hosts and multi-users](specifications#the-generator)**, deployed with [colmena](https://github.com/zhaofengli/colmena) and [just](https://github.com/casey/just).
- **[Host profiles](../ref/host-profiles)** for servers, containers, and workstations.
- **[User profiles](../ref/user-profiles)** providing common configurations for various users.
- **[High-level modules](../ref/modules)** 100% functional with a simple `.enable = true`.
- **[Extensible](#files-organisation)**, scalable, consistent, customizable architecture.
- **[User profiles management](../ref/user-profiles)** with [home manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) + [home profiles](../ref/user-profiles#home-profiles).
- **Automatic homepage** with [Homepage](https://github.com/gethomepage/homepage), based on activated services.
- **Cross-configuration** to ensure network consistency.
- **Easy and reliable security**, a single password to unlock, with [sops](https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix).
- **Multi-networks**, ability to declare multiple networks in one configuration.

## Files organisation

Main folders:

- `lib` -> **Framework**: tools + modules + profiles (users, hosts, themes)
- `usr` -> **Local project**: config, modules + profiles, machines, users
- `src` -> Generator and scripts for tools
- `var` -> Generated files and logs
- `doc` -> Framework documentation

### Layers

The lower layers serve the upper layers.

![DNF Project layers](../../../assets/layers.webp)

The configurations are also organized by category:

- **Standard modules**: Ready-to-use simple modules (just write `.enable = true`).
- **Macro-modules**: Ready-to-use collections of modules with additional configurations.
- **User declarations**: Used to instanciate real users from user profiles.
- **Home profiles**: Contain core Home Manager configurations for each user profile.
- **Tools & configurations**: Manage the generation and quality of Nix declarations.

:::note
For now, the framework is intended to be cloned, with the user's project located in `usr`, which can host an independent git project. A separation between the local project and the framework (which would be a simple input of the local flake) is currently under consideration.
